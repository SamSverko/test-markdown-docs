A sample document with many example text elements.

---

## Headers

## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

## Emphasis

*This text will be italic*

_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**

__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

---

## Lists

### Unordered

  - Like this
  - And this

## Blockquotes

As James Clear said:

> Iâ€™d estimate at least half of my frustrations with others are actually frustrations with myself for failing to set clear boundaries and stand by them."

---

## Inline code

I think you should use an `<addr>` element here instead.

---

## Syntax highlighting

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    console.log('hello there');
  }
}
```
